/**
 * A {@link Runnable} extension which is able to notify its user when it has started/ended running.
 * In addition, this class wraps around a real instance of {@link Runnable}.
 *
 * This is used when invoking various processes in the Arduino editor, in order to know when the process
 * has finished. It seems that the Arduino editor runs most of its tasks such as compiling, uploading to board, etc
 * by launching some threads.
